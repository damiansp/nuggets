# Library imports
#install.packages('sm', dependcies = T)     # etc, if not installed
library(sm)

# Preprocessing prior to this:
#   Changed original file to read only (> chmod a-w)
#   Made copy, 'data.csv' to edit
#   Filled blanks with NA 
#   moved 'revenue' (response var) to first field to be consistent with R
#   commands, e.g. lm(y ~)

# Observations:
# These are time series, and time is clearly an important element
# Each record is a week's data; ordered temporally (top dates = most recent)

# Binary variables (change to categorical vars):
# highseason, holiday, autoenroll, socialperson*, promoteposts*, learner
# *one value in each not = 0 or 1; presumed to be an input error

# Potential outliers in:
# displayimp, displaylag, brandpaid, socialpostimp, Fblikes*, Fbengage* 
# *possibly just very skewed data

# Many data are highly non-normal, though revenue is not so bad
shapiro.test(data$revenue) # not signif different from normal at alpha of 0.05
# Other
# emailsent, emailopen, and emailclick show two distinct trends, with
# transition occurring near index 55

# For the (apparently) binary variables, the values that are not 0/1 are
# assumed to be input errors, and replaced with NAs

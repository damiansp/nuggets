Sample work for CBT Nuggets

This assignment had two main components:

(1) Mining data from Twitter

(2) Analyzing revenue data.

Work done on each is organized into the 'twitter' and 'revenue' directories respectively.

All of the work I performed for this assignment can be viewed most easily in the knitted .html files for the coding done in R, 
and in the Python notebooks for the coding done in Python (but the original R files are present, as is the twitter_mine.py file).
All the .html and .ipynb files are numbered to show the ordering in which the different analyses were conducted and may be
followed sequentially.

For those who want to cut straight to the chase, for the revenue question, the best model was found in the last file 
(7_ML_nuggets2.ipynb), and is in the section obviously marked "Final Model".

Please feel free to contact me if you have any follow up questions.

Thank you all for your time and I look forward to hearing more from you.
